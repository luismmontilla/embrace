"RAW DATA of delta15N and atom% 15N were used for the calculations of 15N incorporation rates. The raw data as well as the calculated rates are now contained in a .txt file named ""N2fix_15N_incorporation.txt""."	
"T0 samples were used to calculate the natural abundance, wich was then substracted from the atom% 15N of the samples to calculate the atom % exess. The T0 data is stored in a .txt file named ""N2fix_15N_T0.txt"""	
"atom percent excess of the incubation medium was measured separately, data is stored in a .txt file named ""N2fix_15N_medium_massspec_results.txt"""	
!!! Only samples with atom%excess over 2.5 x SD of natural abundance is included!!!
