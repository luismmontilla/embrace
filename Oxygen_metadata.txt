Measurements	Oxygen concentration, pH and dry weight	
Instruments	"Oxygen: fiber optic oxygen sensor (FireStingO2, PyroScience, Germany); temperature + pH: pH meter (Multi 3430, WTW, Germany)"	
"RAW DATA of oxygen measurements of all experiments was previously re-arranged to be tabular. This rearranged data (values were not changed, only their position) in now contained in a .txt file named ""Oxygen.txt""."		
The file contains the following variables:		
Experiment	type of experiment (N_fixation, Denitrification, Nitrification)	
Date	date of experiment, format dd.mm.yy	
Time	time of measurement, format hh:mm	
Duration	total incubation time (h)	
Site	sampling site (vent or ambient pH site)	
Incubation	Incubation type (light or dark incubation)	
Treatment	sample treatment (start=before incubation, Y=with epiphytes, N=without epiphytes, C=Control)	
Sample	replicate number (1-max.4)	
Timepoint 	"sampling timepoint (T0=start; T1= ca.5-6h for N-fix experiment; T2= ca. 5-6h for denitrification and nitrification experiment)"	
pH	measured pH	
Oxygen	measured oxygen concentration in _M	
Leaf.DW	dry weight of seagrass leaves (g)	
Epiphyte.DW	dry weight of epiphytes (g)	
		
		
"Data structure and replication: (see figure ""Incubation_scheme.png"")"		
3 treatments	"""+Epi"" = with epiphytes, ""-Epi"" = without epiphytes, ""Ctrl"" =  Control"	
3/4 replicates per treatment	"3 replicates for ""Ctrl"" and ""-Epi""; 4 replicates for ""+Epi"""	
2 sites	"""Vent"" = from vent pH site (pH=7.17 ± 0.04), ""Ambient"" = from ambient pH site (8.12 ± 0.02)"	
4 sampling timepoints	"""T0"", ""T1"", ""T2"", ""T3"" "	only two measurements for T0 (no treatments, only 1 replicate each for vent & ambient pH site) 
2 incubation types 	"""light, ""dark"""	
  = total of 122 vials per experiment		
		
		
Deatails of measurements		
opened vials for measurements (once opened, incubation stopped, vial was sacrificed)		
measured oxygen concentration, pH and temperature		
separated epiphytes from leaves with scalpel, dried leaves and epiphytes at 60¡C for 48 h and weighed separately
