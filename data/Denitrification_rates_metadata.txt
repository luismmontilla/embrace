"RAW DATA of N2 measurements was previously re-arranged to be tabular. This rearranged data (values were not changed, only their position) is now contained in a .txt file named ""Denitrification_rates.txt""."		
Raw data N2 measurements was used for further calculations (see below). 		
		
The file contains the following variables:		
Run	individual run number, note that there were two rounds of runs	
ID	ID of each sample (air standard, reference gas or sample label)	
Site	sampling site (vent or ambient pH site)	
Treatment	sample treatment (Y=with epiphytes, N=without epiphytes, Ctrl=Control, Start= before incubation start, dum=dummy, std=standard, ref = reference gas)	
Incubation	Incubation type (light or dark incubation)	
Incubationtime	total incubation time in h	
Replicate	replicate number	
N28	raw signal of 28N2	
N29	raw signal of 29N2	
N30	raw signal of 30N2	
Total_Signal	sum of 28N2, 29N2 and 30N2 raw signals	
N2_in_Exet	total signal converted into N2 concentration in exetainer (µM) using the regression of the standard curve	
N29_tot	ratio of 29N2 to total N2 raw signal	
N30_tot	ratio of 30N2 to total N2 raw signal	
Ex_N29_tot	atom percent excess, at%29N2 sample Ð at%29N2 control (=N2 reference gas) 	
Ex_N30_tot	atom percent excess, at%30N2 sample Ð at%30N2 control (=N2 reference gas) 	
Conc_N29	"Concentration of 29N2 in µM; product of N2_in_Exet_(µM) and Excess_30N2/tot"	
Conc_N30	"Concentration of 29N2 in µM; product of N2_in_Exet_(µM) and Excess_29N2/tot"	
Amount_N29	amount of 30N per vial (µmol)	
Amount_N30	amount of 29N per vial (µmol)	
N29_prod_rate	29N2 production rate (µmol h-1) as difference of sample - start value, and subtracted by mean Ctrl production rate	
N29_prod_rate_norm	29N2 production rate in nmol h-1 normalized per cm-2 (3cm-2 per leaf)	
N30_prod_rate	30N2 production rate (µmol h-1) as difference of sample - start value, and subtracted by mean Ctrl production rate	
N30_prod_rate_norm	30N2 production rate in nmol h-1 normalized per cm-2 (3cm-2 per leaf)	
D15	production rate of 15N in µmol N h-1, calculated as 29N production rate + 2*30N production rate	
D15_norm	15N production rate in nmol h-1 normalized per cm-2 	
D14	production rate of 14N in µmol N h-1, calculated as (D15*29N production rate)/ (2*30N production rate)	
D14_norm	14N production rate in nmol h-1 normalized per cm-2 	
Dtot	total N production rate, sum of D15+D14	
Dtot_norm	total Nproduction rate in nmol h-1 normalized per cm-2 	
Dn_norm	_coupled nitrificationÐdenitrification, calculated D14-D15	
		
		
"Data structure and replication: (see figure ""Incubation_scheme.png"")"		
3 treatments	"""+Epi"" = with epiphytes, ""-Epi"" = without epiphytes, ""Ctrl"" =  Control"	
3/4 replicates per treatment	"3 replicates for ""Ctrl"" and ""-Epi""; 4 replicates for ""+Epi"""

  = total of 122 vials per experiment		
		
		
Deatails of sampling		
opened vials for measurements (once opened, incubation stopped, vial was sacrificed)		
took samples for N2 (exetainers + 200 uL ZnCl2)		
5ml He headspace, mixed for 60sec
