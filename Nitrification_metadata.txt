Data analysed by	Johanna Berlinghof (johber@uni-bremen.de)	
Experimental date:	13.-19.09.2019	
		
		
Experiments		
volume incubation vials	24 mL	
size leaf sections	3 cm2	
		
Denitrification / Nitrate pulse experiment		
Date	16.09.19	
Label/Tracer	15NH4 (20 µM) 	
Control	labeled site water without leaf/epiphytes	
		
		
Measurements	Nitrification rates	
Instruments	MAT 253PLUS IRMS via Conflo interface (ThermoScientific), measurements conducted by Travis Meador	
		
"RAW DATA of d15N measurements was previously re-arranged to be tabular. This rearranged data (values were not changed, only their position) is now contained in a .txt file named ""Nitrification.txt""."		
Raw data d15N measurements was used for further calculations (see below). 		
		
The file contains the following variables:		
		
Sample	sample label	
Site	sampling site (vent or ambient pH site)	
Incubation	Incubation type (light or dark incubation)	
Treatment	sample treatment (Y=with epiphytes, N=without epiphytes, ctrl=Control, Start= before incubation start)	
Interval	sampling timepoint (T0, T1, T2, T3)	
Time	total incubation time in h 	
d15N-NO3	measured d15N	
d15N-NO3-STD	d15N-NO3 - standard	
atom%	calculated as (100*R*(d15N/1000+1))/(1+R*(d15N/1000+1)), where R is the isotope ratio of the standard (0.0036764) and d15N is the d15N-NO3-STD of the sample	
atom%excess	atom% of the sample - atom% of the T0 ctrl (0.3683)	
std	atom%excess / standard deviation of the T0 ctrl. d15N was considered significant, when std was >2.5	
NO3_conc	concentration of NO3- (uM)	
rate	ammonium oxidation rate in nmol NH4 L-1 d-1, calculated as (atom%excess*NO3_conc)/(atom%medium*incubationtime)*24,  atom%medium = 95.8916	
d15N	d15N-NO3-STD considered significant (higher 2.5 times std)	
		
"Data structure and replication: (see figure ""Incubation_scheme.png"")"		
3 treatments	"""+Epi"" = with epiphytes, ""-Epi"" = without epiphytes, ""Ctrl"" =  Control"	
3/4 replicates per treatment	"3 replicates for ""Ctrl"" and ""-Epi""; 4 replicates for ""+Epi"""	
2 sites	"""Vent"" = from vent pH site (pH=7.17 ± 0.04), ""Ambient"" = from ambient pH site (8.12 ± 0.02)"	
4 sampling timepoints	"""T0"", ""T1"", ""T2"", ""T3"" "	only two measurements for T0 (no treatments, only 1 replicate each for vent & ambient pH site) 
2 incubation types 	"""light, ""dark"""	
  = total of 122 vials per experiment		
		
		
Deatails of sampling		
opened vials for measurements (once opened, incubation stopped, vial was sacrificed)		
took samples for 15N (falcon tubes)		
5ml He headspace, mixed for 60sec
