The file contains the following variables:		
		
sample	Sample type, leaf or epiphyte tissue	
site	sampling site (vent or ambient pH site)	
incubation	Incubation type (light or dark incubation, start = before incubation start)	
treat	sample treatment (Y=with epiphytes, N=without epiphytes, Ctrl=Control)	
time	"sampling timepoint (T0=0h; T1= 5h; T2= 18h)"	
h	total incubation time in h	
replicate	number of sample replicate	
label	sample label on the vials (in the format experiment_site_incubation_timepoint_replicate)	
N	N content (% of dry weight)	
C	C content (% of dry weight)	
CN	C:N ratio (molar), calculated as _(% C/12) / (% N/14)	
		
		
"Data structure and replication: (see figure ""Incubation_scheme.png"")"		
3 treatments	"""+Epi"" = with epiphytes, ""-Epi"" = without epiphytes, ""Ctrl"" =  Control"	
3/4 replicates per treatment	"3 replicates for ""Ctrl"" and ""-Epi""; 4 replicates for ""+Epi"""	
2 sites	"""Vent"" = from vent pH site (pH=7.17 ± 0.04), ""Ambient"" = from ambient pH site (8.12 ± 0.02)"	
4 sampling timepoints	"""T0"", ""T1"", ""T2"""	only two measurements for T0 (no treatments, only 1 replicate each for vent & ambient pH site) 
2 incubation types 	"""light, ""dark"""	
		
		
Deatails of measurements		
Sampled bottles of tracing solutions for 15N-N2 (exetainers + 200 uL ZnCl2), NOx- (LDPE + freeze)		
opened vials for measurements (once opened, incubation stopped, vial was sacrificed)		
Separated epiphytes from leaves and transfered into weighted Eppendorfs (freeze dry)
